# Secure Authenticaton System

#### A Software System for securely authenticating users. Employs password hashing, MFA, and token management.

## How It's Made:

### UML Use Case Diagram
#### Represents how the potential actors (User, Administrator) might interact with the Secure Authentication System in the form of "use cases".

### UML Domain Model
#### Represents the relationships between entities within the larger structure of the Secure Authentication Sysetem domain. 

### UML Class Diagram
#### Based off of the Domain Model, it presents the classes in the Secure Authentication System. Includes Class attributes, methods, and visibility.

### UML Sequence Diagrams
#### Presenting the I/O sequence of events of the Secure Authentication System ("System Sequence Diagram"), and then broken down into specific use cases ("Password Reset" and "MFA Setup"). 

### UML State Diagram
#### Represents the lifecycle of the objects within the Secure Authentication System, including States and Transitions.

### UML Activity Diagram
#### A flowchart that shows the process of events that occur sequentially in the Secure Authentication System. 

### UML Component Diagram
#### Represents the components of the Secure Authentication System and their interactions with an emphasis on a modular view. 

### UML Deployment Diagram
#### Represents the overall deployment structure of the physical architecture, software artifacts, and computational nodes of the Secure Authentication System.

## Lessons Learned:

I always see System Design being mentioned as somethign that comes up in tech iterviews, especially in FAANG. So I was interested to see what this project would actually be like. I was pleasantly surprised to find this project highly useful and immediately applicable to my career goals. It wasn't easy, but it pushed me to improve my skillset which is something I'm eager to do. This was a great project to get my feet in the realm of System Design.
